# VRChat Modding + Photon API Docs

API Docs for modding and information on VRChats PUN API Config

This repo is a collection of things I and other Dev's close to me have documented over the years.

It will be updated on my freetime and will have it's own github.io page eventually

Currently only a list of events will be provided until I free up time with my other projects
